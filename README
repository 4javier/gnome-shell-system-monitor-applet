Install:

Install git if you don't have it: (sudo apt-get install git-core, sudo pacman -S git, etc)
Then :
     mkdir ~/git_projects
     cd ~/git_projects
     git clone git://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet.git
     mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
     cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
     ln -s ~/git_projects/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com
Then install the schema (important):
     sudo cp ~/git_projects/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/org.gnome.shell.extensions.system-monitor.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
     cd /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
     sudo glib-compile-schemas  .
And restart gnome-shell (Alt + F2 -> r) or reboot.
